# SHIELD Sleep Dashboard - Frontend App

This repository contains the frontend component for the SHIELD Sleep Scoring Engine, designed as a React dashboard widget. It allows users to input sleep data, send it to the backend API, and display the calculated SHIELD Sleep Score, Bio-Age Change, and system alerts with suggestions.

## Part 2: Frontend - React Dashboard Widget

This is a React application that provides a dashboard widget for inputting sleep data and displaying the calculated SHIELD Sleep Score, Bio-Age Change, and system alerts with suggestions.

### Architecture

* **Technology Stack:** React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

* **Component-Based:** The application is modularized into three main components:

    * **`App.jsx`:** The root component, managing global state and orchestrating the display of the input form and results.

    * **`SleepInputForm.jsx`:** Handles user input fields and the submission button.

    * **`SleepResultsDisplay.jsx`:** Renders the calculated sleep score, bio-age delta, alerts, and improvement suggestions.

* **State Management:** React's `useState` hook is used for local component state management.

* **API Interaction:** Uses the native `fetch` API to communicate with the Java Spring Boot backend.

* **Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for a modern, responsive, and utility-first styling approach. The Tailwind CDN and custom font are loaded in `public/index.html` for global availability.

### Assumptions

* **Backend Availability:** Assumes the Java Spring Boot backend is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. The frontend will attempt to connect to this URL.

* **CORS:** Relies on the backend to have appropriate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers configured to allow requests from the React application's origin (typically `http://localhost:3000` during local development).

* **Client-Side Validation:** Basic HTML5 form validation is used to provide immediate feedback to the user, complementing the more robust validation performed on the backend.

* **No Routing/Complex Navigation:** Designed as a single-page widget; no advanced routing or multi-page navigation is implemented.

### How to Run and Test the System (Frontend)

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)

* npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js) or Yarn

**Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Backend is Running:**
    Make sure your Java Spring Boot backend application is running first. The frontend will attempt to connect to `http://localhost:8080/api/sleep/score`. Refer to the backend repository's `README.md` for instructions on how to run it.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:soumiksarkar/shield-sleep-dashboard.git
    cd shield-sleep-dashboard
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if using yarn
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Resolve OpenSSL Legacy Provider Issue (if using Node.js v17+):**
    If you encounter `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` errors when running `npm start`, you need to set an environment variable.

    * **For macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm start
        ```

    * **For Windows (Command Prompt):**

        ```cmd
        set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && npm start
        ```

    * **For Windows (PowerShell):**

        ```powershell
        $env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"; npm start
        ```

    Otherwise, you can just run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if using Vite (common for modern React setups)
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deploy a Live Demo (Frontend Specifics)

Deploying the frontend involves hosting the static files generated by the build process.

* **Build Process:** Before deployment, you'll need to build your React application:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # This creates a 'build' folder (or 'dist' for Vite) with optimized assets.
    ```

* **Static Site Hosting:** The `build` (or `dist`) folder can be hosted on various static site hosting services:

    * **Netlify:** Excellent for continuous deployment from Git repositories.

    * **Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, popular for Next.js and React applications.

    * **GitHub Pages:** A simple option for personal projects, directly from a GitHub repository.

    * **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** A robust and scalable solution for static content delivery.

    * **Firebase Hosting:** Easy integration if you are already using Firebase for other services.
